It does not have much complication, the usual flow, download the repository, install dependencies and serve


1. Clone/Download the repository.

```console
git clone https://github.com/udsgit/vue3-router-example
```

2. You may have to install the packages with **NPM**.

npm run serve
```

## **Usage**

1. Open the link from the [Demo](https://vue-router-class.netlify.app/) or execute the serve with the steps above.
2. You can access 2 static routes (Legal and Contact), and the dynamic route that each user is.

Project is: **_Completed._**
